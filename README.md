# Mames

Mames is a project developed for fighting breast cancer using the power of neural networks and Tensorflow.
We analyse hystogram images to classify a tumor in benign or malign, thus making the process faster. So far, we have achieved 80% accuracy.

* Note, this project is still on development and should not be used to base or substitute any medical orientation.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries. Note that for the current date, Tensorflow is not compatible with python 3.9.

```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a demonstration of the program working
